Project, responsive for desktop and mobile. It was made with technologies such as React JS, Redux, CSS Modules, Node and Express, fetching data from https://rickandmortyapi.com/ . It is not finished yet, I have still to finish the data base and connect it to the backend of the app.
Thanks for watching :D. If you want to try it, probe with npm start both in back and front directories.
